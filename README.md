# Machine Learning Plate

This is a plate of machine learning algorithm implementation tastes made of Python and Numpy. Enjoy!  

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Maximum Entropy Method (in progress)
4. _more algorithms on the way..._  

## Conventions
* X: a data matrix, shaped as (|num_x|, |num_features|) 
* X[i]: the ith data record
* Y: a label vector, corresponding to X 
* Y[i]: the i the label record, corresponding to X[i]
* x: a feature vector, x = X[i] 
* y: a label scalar, corresponding to x, y = Y[i]
