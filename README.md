# Machine Learning Plate

This is a plate of machine learning algorithm implementation tastes made of Python and Numpy. Enjoy!  

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Maximum Entropy Method
4. Perceptron
5. _more algorithms on the way..._  

## Conventions
* X: a data matrix, shaped as (|num_x|, |num_features|) 
* Y: a label vector, corresponding to X 
* W: a weight matrix, shaped as (|num_labels|, |num_features|)
* Z: a sum over probabilities of all labels / a vector showing sums over weights dot x features
* X[i]: the ith data record
* Y[i]: the ith label record, corresponding to X[i]
* W[i]: the weight vector for label i
* x: a feature vector, x = X[i] 
* y: a label scalar, corresponding to x, y = Y[i]
* w: a feature weight vector
* z: a scalar showing sums over weights dot x features
* b: a bias
